The world is composed of fixed maps connected through wilderness maps.
When the player is in a wilderness map, he can Travel, which takes him to the world map.
While in the world map, the only available commands are Explore and Look. 
When a player moves to a fixed map in the world map (like a town), he is automatically transported to the local map.
Wilderness maps are generated randomly choosing from different biomes.
Wilderness maps include random monsters, plants and NPCs.
When travelling across the world map, the player can get an ? or ! symbol.
?: optional encounter with a friendly NPC
!: mandatory encounter with an enemy
Tents can be built in wilderness and allow to rest, restoring all your health and mana.
The same effect is reached by sleeping in inns.
Sleeping is a word that can only be casted to a nearby bed or tent.
When hit, a wound is created. Some HPs are lost permantly, while others can be recovered as soon as the wound is cured.
Wounds can be cured with plants, potions and magic.
Wounds are cured automatically over time. While recovering, more energy is consumed.
Mercenaries can be recruited at inns.
Mercenaries are procedurally generated from a series of classes and character traits.
Mercenaries say random comments regarding the current situation at random times.
There are ancient portals scattered across the world that allows to travel through them once properly activated.

It
is thoroughly devoted to the worship of Tiamat,
the dragon-queen of chaos, with all other deities
being relegated to minor status. Babylon is ruled
by the blue-bearded priests of Tiamat, who in turn
serve the kingpriest, mightiest of all rulers in the
Fertile Crescent.

Farther east, a handful of impregnable for-
tress-cities are situated along the river-valleys
of the interior Zagros Mountains. These cities
are home to exiled warlords, tyrannical princes,
and strange cults. Among the latter are the
veiled monks of Ong, a monastic order of yel-
low-robed mystics of whom little is known but
much is speculated. No foreigner has ever been
inside their forbidden monastery on the frigid
plateau of Ong.

A northeastern offshoot of the Sumerian swamp-
delta, close to the great river Tigris, the loathsome
marshland known as the Black Marshes of Nammat
is avoided by most travelers, who prefer to follow
the longer trade routes to the southeast.

The cold and hostile mountains might be
avoided by civilized men were it not for the
fact that the verdant mountain slopes abound
with rare and wondrous herbs, such as the Blue
Lotus, which induces deep trances and strange
visions, and the K'lamtra herb, which is fa-
vored by black magicians for its usefulness in
death rituals.

The goal is to retrieve the Amulet of Thot.
The amulet is located deep beneath the Ancient Caverns.
Areas are composed of 5 floors that share the same setting (cavern, forest, etc).
Floors within the same area are connected by stairs.
Areas are connected by portals.
Portals can only used downwards unless the amulet is equipped.
Portals are custodiated by bosses.
There's a monster that drains your health in real time.

Nebium: The strongest and one of the rarest metals.
It is dead-black, silk-smooth and very dense. The se-
cret of its manufacture has been lost in Thongor’s
day, but Alchemists continue to search

ancient forest realm of Athel
Loren, a fell place of mist and shadow that stretches over
hundreds of miles, dominating much of the western edge of
the Grey Mountains. While Athel Loren is nominally a part
of Bretonnia, no Lord of that realm has ever seen fit to claim
the place and with good reason. It is the kingdom of the Forrest
Elves, estranged kin of the folk of Ulthuan who keep their own
counsel under the leafy canopy.

Black Ones are black and naked, madelike men, but the shortest of them areheads and shoulders above a tall human.They are rangy, rather than massive, butare finely formed, with no suggestion ofdeformity or abnormality, save as theirgreat height is abnormal. But one cansense the basic diabolism of their features;every line, each feature is stamped withevil — evil transcending the evil of human-ity. Under their ebon skin long, roundedmuscles ripple, and the monsters can rendan ordinary man limb from limb. The nailsof the fingers are grown like the talons of awild beast. Their eyes are tawny, a vibrantgold that glows and glitters. They arenaked and hairless.Black Ones do not speak — vocally.  Theynod and gesture, but are strangely silent.They find pleasure in dragging to light theabysmal secrets that sleep in theunfathomed darkness of the human soul.They worship dark gods and live forever,save for violence or accident.

This world is filled with death and decay. Vengeful hordes wash across the land. Ancient empires have been reduced to city-states run by petty warlords who fight among them­selves like ravenous dogs. Disease runs rampant. Illiterate city-folk and simple farmers dread that which lurks in the dark.

The Purging Stone does not dispel curses,
but receives them as a surrogate. The stone

The Skaven are commanded by the insidious Lords of Decay, a
collection of aged and terrible beings that sit upon the Council
of Thirteen, the ruling body of the Skaven race. Their capital
city, Skavenblight, is an ancient ruin that supposedly resides
near the centre of the cursed marshes that lie on the western
borders of Tilea. From the mouldering halls of Skavenblight,
the Lords of Decay conspire to expand their influence and
power, usually by seizing the underground kingdoms of the
Dwarfs and Goblins

The Skaven are divided into a series of clans, all of which
constantly jostle for position and influence with the Council of
Thirteen. The bulk of their clans consist of warriors and slaves
they’ve captured from rivals that they’ve eliminated; however, all
of the greatest clans among them have developed specialties that
set them apart, allowing each to carve out their own niche which
they ruthlessly cling to, destroying any threats to their position.
The Warlock Engineers of Clan Skryre presently have the most
power and thus, the most influence with the Lords of Decay.
They specialise in the creation and utilization of strange sorcerous
machines powered by a variety of Warpstone based devices, some
of which they’ve taken from other races for “modification” others
being entirely original to them. Ultimately, all of their machines
are designed to kill others and occasionally, their wielders.

Skaven are usually fairly cunning and always malicious, but
they’re prone to cowardice. They are confident only in large
numbers, when they greatly outnumber their opponents. They’re
obsequious to those they consider stronger than themselves,
though they will seldom hesitate to plant a dagger in the back of
a superior if they think they can get away with it. Assassination
is a commonplace and accepted way to advance one’s fortunes in
Skaven society. The Lords of Decay believe infighting makes
the Skaven race stronger as a whole. Conveniently enough, it
also means most of their inferiors don’t have time to plot against
them. Skaven workmanship is fairly shoddy by Human standards,
and reprehensible to dwarfs, but it is usually crudely effective.
The majority of Skaven have a lifespan of a mere thirty years,
with few indeed getting to die of natural causes. However,
repeated exposure to Warpstone can have a large variety of effects
on the Skaven, not least of which is a greatly extended lifespan.
Several of the Lords of Decay are supposedly well over a thousand
years old. When Skaven communicate, they use a great deal
more than words to convey meaning. Their gestures and more
importantly, their smell, helps to accurately convey their mood
to other Skaven. A furious Skaven smells of heated iron, whereas
the acrid stench of the musk of fear commonly shrouds a rat-man
who expects to die.

The Skaven worship an entity known as the Horned Rat, a
malevolent being served by the Grey Seers, a group of powerful
wizards and prophets who preach the ascension of the Skaven.
While they are nominally subject to the dictates of the Council
of Thirteen, their personal power makes individual Grey Seers
a constant wild card in Skaven politics. Grey Seers frequently
consume Warpstone to fuel their sorcery, a practice that
does little good for their sanity and other Skaven rightfully
fear them. The Horned Rat’s symbol, which has effectively
become the defining mark of the Skaven race, consists of three
overlapping lines roughly sketched in a vaguely triangular
pattern.

From the distant Land of Chill
come raiders to the shores of the
Old World, depraved warriors
bent on slavery and conquest.
Little is known of them in the
Empire and the few Elven envoys
that come from Ulthuan are loath to
speak about them, ever preferring
to avoid the subject when they
can or answer tersely when they
cannot.

Clad in corroded armor, their lifeless hands gripping swords, spears and shields these mindless automatons take up their blades when the clarion call of battle sounds, ready once more to fight for their king.

Dotted around the untamed regions are the ancient ruins of temples, cities, tombs and palaces toppled and cracked, choked with weeds and undergrowth, lying untouched and awaiting discovery for the vast treasures that remain within their shadowed halls and empty corridors.
